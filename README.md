## 💡 Why ReVoice?  

While people who travel by **car or bus** can read or listen using their devices,  
those who travel by **scooter, bike, or public transport** often can’t read safely.  

🎧 **ReVoice** was built to bridge this gap —  
it lets you **listen, learn, and revise your notes hands-free**, anywhere, anytime!  

> "When your eyes can’t read, your ears still can." 👂💡
