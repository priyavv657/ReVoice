## 🚀 Features  

✨ **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts your notes into natural, human-like speech

⏩ **Adjustable Speed:** Customize playback from 0.75× to 1.5×  
🔁 **Repeat Count:** Control how many times each section is repeated

## 💡 Why ReVoice?  

While people who travel by **car or bus** can read or listen using their devices,  
those who travel by **scooter, bike, or public transport** often can’t read safely.  

🎧 **ReVoice** was built to bridge this gap —  
it lets you **listen, learn, and revise your notes hands-free**, anywhere, anytime!  

> "When your eyes can’t read, your ears still can." 👂💡

## 🧠 Reason for Building ReVoice

I built **ReVoice** to help people who can’t read while traveling —
especially those who commute via bike, scooter, or public transport.

Instead of just reading notes, they can now **listen** to them safely.
Making learning possible even when your hands — and eyes — are busy 🚴‍♀️🎧
